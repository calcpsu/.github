I am committed to these designs being open source and available for others to use, understand, share, and improve.
However, I request they are not reproduced commercially. Should the demand arise I intend to provide some for sale in the future.
If you want to enquire about purchasing in the interim, please contact me at info@calcpsu.com.au.
